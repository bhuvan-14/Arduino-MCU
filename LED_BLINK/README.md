**ðŸ“Œ Overview**

This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking sequence using an Arduino board. Two LEDs are connected to pins 9 and 6, and they are turned ON and OFF in a timed pattern.

**ðŸ›  Components Required**

Proteus 8 
Arduino Uno (or compatible board) 
2 Ã— LEDs (any color)
2 Ã— 220Î© resistors, wires

**âš™ Circuit Diagram**

LED1 â†’ Pin 9 â†’ Resistor â†’ GND  
LED2 â†’ Pin 6 â†’ Resistor â†’ GND

**ðŸ“œ Working Principle**

LED1 turns ON for 2 seconds.
LED2 turns ON while LED1 turns OFF, for 2 seconds.
LED1 turns ON again with LED2 still ON for 2 seconds.
Both LEDs turn OFF for 2 seconds, and the cycle repeats.

**ðŸ”„ Sequence Timing**

  Step	LED1	LED2	Delay
  
  1   	ON	  OFF	  2s
  
  2	    OFF	  ON	  2s
  
  3	    ON	  ON	  2s
  
  4	    OFF	  OFF	  2s

**ðŸ“Ž Notes**

You can change the delay() values to adjust blink speed.
Use resistors to prevent LED damage.
This example is beginner-friendly and ideal for understanding digitalWrite() and delay() function
