**ðŸ“Œ Overview**

This project demonstrates how to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to gradually increase and decrease an LEDâ€™s brightness, creating a fade inâ€“fade out effect.

**ðŸ›  Components Required**

Arduino Uno ,Proteus

Oscilloscope

1 Ã— LED (any color)

1 Ã— 220Î© resistor

Breadboard & jumper wires\

**(Make sure the PWM pin supports analogWrite() â€” on Arduino Uno, pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 are PWM capable.)**

**ðŸ“œ Working Principle**

The analogWrite() function sends a PWM signal to the LED.

In the first loop, wave increases gradually from 0 (OFF) to 255 (fully ON).

In the second loop, wave decreases gradually back to 0.

The cycle repeats, creating a smooth fading effect.

**ðŸ”„ Waveform Cycle**

Step	 Value	Effect on Wave

0 â†’ 255	Increasing	Fading IN

255 â†’ 0	Decreasing	Fading OUT


**ðŸ“Ž Notes**

The delay(10) controls fade speed â€” smaller values make faster fading, larger values make slower fading.

PWM doesnâ€™t change voltage directly; it switches it on and off rapidly to simulate dimming.

Works on any PWM-capable pin.
